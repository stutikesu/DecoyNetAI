DecoyNet AI
DecoyNet AI is a cybersecurity solution that uses Generative AI (GANs) for generating realistic decoys, Reinforcement Learning for optimizing trap deployment, and Autoencoders for detecting anomalies. The system is designed to proactively defend organizations against cyber threats by deploying decoys that deceive attackers, triggering alerts without causing harm to actual infrastructure.

Overview
DecoyNet AI creates realistic decoys (files, network activities, etc.) using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The system also incorporates Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize the deployment of traps and Anomaly Detection using Autoencoders to continuously monitor for potential cyber threats.

The Flask-based web interface allows users to interact with the system, deploy new decoys, and view the current status of the system.

Requirements
Before running DecoyNet AI, ensure the following dependencies are installed:

Python 3.8+ (preferably Python 3.9 or above)
Flask (for the web server)
PyTorch (for GAN training)
Other Python libraries listed in the requirements.txt
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DecoyNetAI.git
cd DecoyNetAI
Create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:
bash
Copy code
venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Install dependencies: Ensure you have requirements.txt in your project folder (you may need to create it if not already provided). Run the following command to install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running DecoyNet AI
Once all dependencies are installed, follow these steps to run DecoyNet AI:

Start the Flask web server: Run the following command in your terminal:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Access the web dashboard: Open your browser and go to:

arduino
Copy code
http://localhost:5000
This will display the DecoyNet AI Dashboard where you can:

View the system status (active traps, decoy status).
Deploy new decoys.
View the current state of the system (JSON format).
Usage
Deploy New Decoy: Clicking on "Deploy New Decoy" will trigger the system to generate and deploy a new decoy (e.g., a fake file, network packet, etc.) using the Generative AI model (GAN). The system status will be updated in real-time.

View System Status: The dashboard will show the current number of active traps and the decoy status.
